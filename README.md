## Project Description

Netflix-Clone is developed in connection to my learning of React and creating a slick UI to showcase my web development skills. A Movie Database [TMDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) is used to fetch movies using [axios](https://www.axios.com/). Users can view a list of movies which are generated randomly on each page refresh.
